Gynaecomastia / Male Breasts / Man-boobs

Gynaecomastia or ‘Male Breasts’ or so called ‘man-boobs’ develop due to the presence of immature mammary glands in male chest area 
(in women such glands on maturity produce milk for breast feeding of baby after pregnancy). Following the pattern of breast formation, 
in the chest area some resistant fat may also get deposited around and between the glands. Below are answers to some of the most 
common queries we receive from boys suffering from Gynaecomastia or from their parents or guardians.

Why do some boys and men develop big breasts like women?

Male Breast results from an imbalance between androgen (male hormone) and oestrogen (female hormone) activity. 
This development happens at 12-14 years of age. In some boys, there is a fall in male hormone at the time of 
puberty for a variable period, instead of a rise, for reasons still not known. The female hormones in the body 
are then unopposed by the male hormones. The visible effect of this is that boys develop mammary glands in their 
breasts. Once the glands are laid down in the breasts area, they do not regress. As the hormones stabilize, 
further development of the mammary glands stops. Male Breasts do not develop due to obesity (becoming fat). 
Obesity only increases the size of the breasts due to more fat deposition between and around the mammary glands.
